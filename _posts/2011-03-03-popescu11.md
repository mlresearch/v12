title: Robust Statistics for Describing Causality in Multivariate Time Series.
abstract: 'A widely agreed upon definition of time series causality inference, established
  in the seminal 1969 article of Clive \citetGranger1969, is based on the relative
  ability of the history of one time series to predict the current state of another,
  conditional on all other past information. While the Granger Causality (GC) principle
  remains uncontested, its literal application is challenged by practical and physical
  limitations of the process of discretely sampling continuous dynamic systems. Advances
  in methodology for time-series causality subsequently evolved mainly in econometrics
  and brain imaging: while each domain has specific data and noise characteristics
  the basic aims and challenges are similar. Dynamic interactions may occur at higher
  temporal or spatial resolution than our ability to measure them, which leads to
  the potentially false inference of causation where only correlation is present.  
  Causality assignment can be seen as the principled partition of spectral coherence
  among interacting signals using both auto-regressive (AR) modeling and spectral
  decomposition. While both approaches are theoretically equivalent, interchangeably
  describing linear dynamic processes, the purely spectral approach currently differs
  in its somewhat higher ability to accurately deal with mixed additive noise. Two
  new methods are introduced 1) a purely auto-regressive method named Causal Structural
  Information is introduced which unlike current AR-based  methods is robust to mixed
  additive noise and 2) a novel means of calculating multivariate spectra for unevenly
  sampled data based on cardinal trigonometric functions is  incorporated into the
  recently introduced phase slope index (PSI) spectral causal inference method (Nolte
  et al. 2008). In addition to these, PSI,  partial coherence-based PSI and existing
  AR-based causality measures were tested on a specially constructed data-set simulating
  possible confounding effects of mixed noise and another additionally testing the
  influence of common, background driving signals. Tabulated statistics are provided
  in which true causality influence is subjected to an acceptable level of false inference
  probability.'
