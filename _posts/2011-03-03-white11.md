title: Linking Granger Causality and the Pearl Causal Model with Settable Systems
abstract: The causal notions embodied in the concept of Granger causality have been
  argued to belong to a different category than those of Judea Pearlâ€™s Causal Model,
  and so far their relation has remained obscure. Here, we demonstrate that these
  concepts are in fact closely linked by showing how each relates to straightforward
  notions of direct causality embodied in settable systems, an extension and refinement
  of the Pearl Causal Model designed to accommodate optimization, equilibrium, and
  learning. We then provide straightforward practical methods to test for direct causality
  using tests for Granger causality.
