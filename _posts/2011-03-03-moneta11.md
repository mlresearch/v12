title: Causal Search in Structural Vector Autoregressive Models
abstract: This paper reviews a class of methods to perform causal inference in the
  framework of a structural vector autoregressive model. We consider three different
  settings. In the first setting the underlying system is linear with normal disturbances
  and the structural model is identified by exploiting the information incorporated
  in the partial correlations of the estimated residuals. Zero partial correlations
  are used as input of a search algorithm formalized via graphical causal models.
  In the second, semi-parametric, setting the underlying system is linear with non-Gaussian
  disturbances. In this case the structural vector autoregressive model is identified
  through a search procedure based on independent component analysis. Finally, we
  explore the possibility of causal search in a nonparametric setting by studying
  the performance of conditional independence tests based on kernel density estimations.
