title: Time Series Analysis with the Causality Workbench
abstract: The Causality Workbench project is an environment to test causal discovery
  algorithms. Via a web portal http://clopinet.com/causality, it provides a number
  of resources, including a repository of datasets, models, and software packages,
  and a virtual laboratory allowing users to benchmark causal discovery algorithms
  by performing virtual experiments to study artificial causal systems. We regularly
  organize competitions. In this paper, we describe what the platform offers for the
  analysis of causality in time series analysis.
