font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>A widely agreed upon definition of time
series causality inference, established in the seminal 1969 article of Clive
\citet{Granger1969}, is based on the relative ability of the history of one
time series to predict the current state of another, conditional on all other
past information. While the Granger Causality (GC) principle remains
uncontested, its literal application is challenged by practical and physical
limitations of the process of discretely sampling continuous dynamic systems.
Advances in methodology for time-series causality subsequently evolved mainly
in econometrics and brain imaging: while each domain has specific data and
noise characteristics the basic aims and challenges are similar. Dynamic
interactions may occur at higher temporal or spatial resolution than our
ability to measure them, which leads to the potentially false inference of
causation where only correlation is present.   Causality assignment can be seen
as the principled partition of spectral coherence among interacting signals
using both auto-regressive (AR) modeling and spectral decomposition. While both
approaches are theoretically equivalent, interchangeably describing linear
dynamic processes, the purely spectral approach currently differs in its
somewhat higher ability to accurately deal with mixed additive noise. Two new
methods are introduced 1) a purely auto-regressive method named Causal
Structural Information is introduced which unlike current AR-based  methods is
robust to mixed additive noise and 2) a novel means of calculating multivariate
spectra for unevenly sampled data based on cardinal trigonometric functions is 
incorporated into the recently introduced phase slope index (PSI) spectral
causal inference method (Nolte et al. 2008). In addition to these, PSI, 
partial coherence-based PSI and existing AR-based causality measures were
tested on a specially constructed data-set simulating possible confounding
effects of mixed noise and another additionally testing the influence of
common, background driving signals. Tabulated statistics are provided in which
true causality influence is subjected to an acceptable level of false inference
probability.</span></p>
